## Overview

`pathfindR` is a tool for enrichment analysis via active subnetworks. The package also offers functionalities to cluster the enriched terms and identify representative terms in each cluster, to score the enriched terms per sample and to visualize analysis results.
    
The functionalities of pathfindR is described in detail in _Ulgen E, Ozisik O, Sezerman OU. 2019. pathfindR: An R Package for Comprehensive Identification of Enriched Pathways in Omics Data Through Active Subnetworks. Front. Genet. [https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00858](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00858)_

See [the pathfindR wiki](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki) for detailed documentation.

## Installation

You can install the released version of pathfindR from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("pathfindR")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# if you have not installed "devtools"
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("egeulgen/pathfindR")
```

We also have docker images available on Docker Hub:

``` bash
# pull image for latest release
docker pull egeulgen/pathfindr:latest

# pull image for specific version (e.g. 1.3.0)
docker pull egeulgen/pathfindr:1.3.0

# pull image for development version
docker pull egeulgen/pathfindr:dev
```

> **NOTE**

> For the active subnetwork search component to work, the user must have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp) installed and path/to/java must be in the PATH environment variable.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki/Installation) for more details.


## Enrichment Analysis with pathfindR

![pathfindR Enrichment Workflow](./vignettes/pathfindr.png?raw=true "pathfindr Enrichment Workflow")

This workflow takes in a data frame consisting of Gene symbols, log-fold-change (optional) and associated p values. The first 3 lines of an example input data frame looks like:

```{r example_input}
head(RA_input, 3)
```

After input testing, any gene symbol that is not in the chosen protein-protein interaction network (PIN) is converted to an alias symbol if there is an alias that is in the PIN. After mapping the input genes with the associated p values onto the PIN, active subnetwork search is performed. The resulting active subnetworks are then filtered based on their scores and the number of significant genes they contain. These filtered list of active subnetworks are then used for enrichment analyses, i.e. using the genes in each of the active subnetworks, the significantly enriched terms (pathways/gene sets) are identified. Enriched terms with adjusted p values larger than the given threshold are discarded and the lowest adjusted p value (over all active subnetworks) for each term is kept. This process of `active subnetwork search + enrichment analyses` is repeated for a selected number of iterations, performed in parallel. Over all iterations, the lowest and the highest adjusted-p values, as well as number of occurrences over all iterations are reported for each significantly enriched term.

This workflow can be run using the function `run_pathfindR`:

``` r
library(pathfindR)
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input)

# to change the output directory
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, output_dir = "new_directory")

# to change the PIN (default = Biogrid)
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, pin_name_path = "IntAct")
# to use an external PIN of user's choice
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, pin_name_path = "/path/to/myPIN.sif")

# to change the active subnetwork search algorithm (default = "GR", i.e. greedy algorithm)
# for simulated annealing:
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, search_method = "SA")

# to change the number of iterations (default = 10)
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, iterations = 25) 

# to manually specify the number processes used during parallel loop by foreach
# defaults to the number of detected cores (See ?parallel::detectCores()) 
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, n_processes = 2)

# to report the non-DEG active subnetwork genes
RA_output <- run_pathfindR(RA_input, list_active_snw_genes = TRUE)
```

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki/Enrichment%20Documentation) for more details.


## Clustering of the Enriched Terms

![Enriched Terms Clustering Workflow](./vignettes/term_clustering.png?raw=true "Enriched Terms Clustering Workflow")
The wrapper function for this workflow is `cluster_enriched_terms()`.

This workflow first calculates the pairwise kappa statistics between the enriched terms. The function then performs hierarchical clustering (by default), automatically determines the optimal number of clusters by maximizing the average silhouette width and returns a data frame with cluster assignments.

``` r
# default settings
RA_clustered <- cluster_enriched_terms(RA_output)

# to display the heatmap of hierarchical clustering
RA_clustered <- cluster_enriched_terms(RA_output, plot_hmap = TRUE)

# to display the dendrogram and clusters
RA_clustered <- cluster_enriched_terms(RA_output, plot_dend = TRUE)

# to change agglomeration method (default = "average")
RA_clustered <- cluster_enriched_terms(RA_output, clu_method = "centroid")
```

Alternatively, the `fuzzy` clustering method (as described in Huang DW, Sherman BT, Tan Q, et al. The DAVID Gene Functional Classification Tool: a novel biological module-centric algorithm to functionally analyze large gene lists. Genome Biol. 2007;8(9):R183.) can be used:

``` r
RA_clustered_fuzzy <- cluster_enriched_terms(RA_output, method = "fuzzy")
```

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki/Clustering%20Documentation) for more details.

## Term-Gene Graph Visualization

The function `term_gene_graph` (adapted from the Gene-Concept network visualization by the R package `enrichplot`) can be utilized to visualize which significant genes are involved in the enriched terms. The function creates the term-gene graph, displaying the connections between genes and biological terms (enriched pathways or gene sets). This allows for the investigation of multiple terms to which significant genes are related. The graph also enables determination of the degree of overlap between the enriched terms by identifying shared and/or distinct significant genes.

![Term-Gene Graph](./vignettes/term_gene.png?raw=true "Term-Gene Graph")

For more details, see the [wiki page](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki/Term-Gene-Graph).

## Per Sample Enriched Term Scores

![Agglomerated Scores for all Enriched Terms per Sample](./vignettes/score_hmap.png?raw=true "Scoring per Sample")
 
The function `calculate_scores` can be used to calculate the agglomerated z score of each enriched term per sample. This allows the user to individually examine the scores and infer how a term is overall altered (activated or repressed) in a given sample or a group of samples.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/egeulgen/pathfindR/wiki/Enriched-Term-Scoring) for more details.
