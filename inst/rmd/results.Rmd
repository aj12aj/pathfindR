pathfindR-Enrichment results are presented below:

## [All pathways found to be enriched](./enriched_pathways.html)
A table that lists all pathways found to be enriched as well as lists of up- or down-regulated genes for each pathway. If it was requested, the pathway descriptions (names) are linked to the visualizations of these pathways with differentially-expressed genes colored according to change values.

## [Tables of genes with converted gene symbols and genes without interactions](./conversion_table.html)
- A table listing the genes whose symbols (Old Symbol) were converted to aliases (Converted Symbol) that were in the protein-protein interaction network.
- A table listing the input genes for which no interactions in the PIN were found (after the aliases were also checked).
